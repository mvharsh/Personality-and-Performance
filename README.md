## THE IMPACT OF PERSONALITY TRAITS ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE: A STUDY USING REGRESSION AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS WITH BIG FIVE MODEL 

The background and motivation of the study are to explore the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and academic performance. Specifically, the study aims to determine whether these personality traits have a significant impact on academic performance, and to what extent. The study intends to use regression and correlation analysis to examine the relationship between personality traits and academic performance. The results of the study can have significant implications for educators and policymakers, as understanding the relationship between personality traits and academic performance can help develop effective educational strategies and interventions. Additionally, the findings can provide insight into the factors that contribute to student success and help identify students who may need additional support.

### Big Five personality traits model
In the study, data on personality traits and academic performance were collected from a sample of school and college students. The five factors of the Big Five personality model, namely openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, were measured using a survey that included questions related to each trait. Participants were asked to rate their responses on a Likert scale of 1 to 5. 

The Big Five personality traits model is a widely accepted framework for understanding human personality. It identifies five major dimensions of personality:

a)	**Openness**: Refers to a person's level of imagination, creativity, and openness to new experiences.

b)	**Conscientiousness**: Refers to a person's level of organization, responsibility, and self-discipline.

c)	**Extraversion**: Refers to a person's level of social energy, assertiveness, and enthusiasm for social interaction.

d)	**Agreeableness**: Refers to a person's level of cooperativeness, empathy, and concern for others.

e)	**Neuroticism**: Refers to a person's level of emotional instability, anxiety, and moodiness.

### Data Collection

An online survey form was created using Google Forms for data collection in our study. The URL of the form was shared through various social media platforms and emails to reach a large sample size of college and school students. The form included questions related to personality traits and academic performance, which could be answered by participants using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Additionally, data on participants' age and gender was collected.

### Conclusion

 - The first finding of the study was that there was no multicollinearity between each of the Big Five factors, indicating that each factor was unique and contributed to the prediction of academic performance independently. 
 
 - The second finding was that the R-squared value was good, indicating that the model could predict academic performance well.
 
 - The third finding was that the support vector regression (SVR) method had the lowest mean squared error (MSE) value, which means that it performed the best among all the regression methods tested. Therefore, the SVR method was selected as the preferred method to predict academic performance.
 
 - The heatplot showed that openness and conscientiousness had a positive correlation with CGPA, with correlation coefficients of 0.42 and 0.43, respectively. This indicates that as the values of openness and conscientiousness increase, the CGPA of the students also tends to increase.
 
 -  On the other hand, neuroticism had a negative correlation with CGPA, with a correlation coefficient of -0.48. This means that as the value of neuroticism increases, the CGPA tends to decrease.


Based on these findings, the study concluded that personality traits are significantly related to academic performance among university students. 
- Openness and conscientiousness were found to be positively related to academic performance
- Neuroticism was found to be negatively related
